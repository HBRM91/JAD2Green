## Deviations from spec
- PostgreSQL run for tests uses portable pg17 at ~/AppData/Local/pg17_portable (no system install).
  Tests connect as 'app_user' (non-superuser) to exercise RLS, matching Supabase 'authenticated' role.
  Teardown uses pg_ctl stop -m fast (Windows-compatible; SIGINT not supported on Win32).
- git push blocked by 403 on local proxy (62f615b committed locally, will retry).

## OPEN QUESTIONS (stop and ask rather than guess on invariants)
- none
